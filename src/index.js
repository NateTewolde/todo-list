console.log("hi there");

//the plan...
//make a default template similar to the tabs in
//the resturant project. It will include the top bar and the
//side bar. Maybe it will be coded into html as it mainly doesnt change,
//things just get added to it like projects but that part can be js.

//Step 1: Make top and side nav with HTMl, ask in TOP disc if good idea
//Step 2: Make a module for each new page or screen:
//  - Inbox, Today, This Week, Important, Projects
//maybe use library book form reworked for making todolists
